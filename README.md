# Rainbow DQN vs PPO Comparison

A configurable implementation comparing Rainbow DQN and PPO algorithms on the
LunarLander-v3 environment. Both algorithms have flaggable features to study the impact of
different components.

## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements

### System Dependencies

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install swig build-essential python3-dev
```

### Python Dependencies

Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all dependencies. Both algorithms use
similar network sizes for fair comparison
